            and glory. Will you delve deep into cavernous expanses in search of treasure and raw materials with 
            which to craft ever-evolving gear, machinery, and aesthetics? Perhaps you will choose instead to

            own city to house the host of mysterious allies you may encounter along your travels?

            <br>

                <p>King Slime is one of the easiest bosses, and one of the first a player will beat in a playthrough. 
                    To beat King Slime, I suggest for: <br> <br> rangers: gold/platinum bow <br>summoner: the snapthorn,
                    and flinx staff or vampire frog staff<br> mage: ruby staff or better  <br> melee: amazon or enchanted sword

                    thorn chrakram. <br> For expert or master mode, it is a must to have hermes boots to dodge the 
                    dash attacks in its second form, the last 50% of its health. </p>

                <summary><b>Eater of Worlds</b></summary>
                <p>This boss can be easily beaten if you have a piercing weapon. I suggest for: <br><br> ranger: gold/platinum bow or demonite bow, with 
                jester arrows<br> summoner: snapthorn, with the vampire frog staff <br> mage: the vilethorn <br> melee:

                <summary><b>Brain of Cthulhu</b></summary>
                <p>For the first stage, before all the minions have been defeated, it is best to use a piercing weapon, or a weapon that 
                    hits multiple targets. I suggest for: <br> <br> ranger: crimtane/gold/platinum bow with jester arrows or minishark <br> 
                    summoner: snapthorn, with the vampire frog staff <br> mage: space gun or gem staves <br> melee: rotted fork, or

                <p>This boss is the only mandatory boss in pre-hardmode (in terms of progression) and if beated, changes the world into 
                    hardmode. I suggest for: <br> <br> rangers: hellwing bow, or the bee's knees along with beenades<br> summoner: spinal tap

                <summary><b>Pre-Mech Duke Fishron</b></summary>
                <p>Pre-mech Duke Fishron is a hard bossfight, but is doable with the right set up. Achieving this can give you some of the 
                    best gear, and carry you almost the whole way through hardmode. The fishron wings are the best you can get early hardmode, and 
                    the tsunami bow can carry you to the lunar events, which is the same with the razorblade typhoon, and the tempest staff is a good option.

                    <br>
                    <b>Weapons for this fight: </b><br>
                    <br> ranger: Daedalus stormbow with ichor arrows and/or uzi with crystal bullets.
                    <br> summoner: sanguine staff and cool/firecracker whip 
                    <br> mage: spirit flame and golden shower
                    <br> melee: bananarang and/or shadowflame knives
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Accessories for this fight:</b> <br> <br>
                    Amphibian boots<br> frozen wings (or equivalent)<br> shield of Cthulhu<br> worm scarf <b>or</b> brain of Cthulhu<br> charm of myths.
                    <br><br><b> For class specific accessories: </b><br>
                    <br>ranger: Stalker's quiver, ranger emblem
                    <br>summoner: Pygmy necklace, summoner emblem
                    <br>mage: mana cloak, sorcerer emblem
                    <br>melee: power glove, warrior emblem
                    <br><br><b>Armour:</b>
                    <br> ranger: titanium/adamantite armour
                    <br> summoner: spider armour
                    <br> mage: titanium/adamantite armour
                    <br> melee: titanium/adamantite armour
                    <br><br><b>Arena setup:</b>
                    <br>In the ocean, make a planter box platform from the beach to the end of the world. Then fly up and use the ice rod, 
                    to make a floating block, and then place planter boxes on either side of it. <b>Make sure that you can reach the 2nd platform easily, not too 
                    high that you can't reach by simply flying.</b> Add campfires, and heart lanterns.
                    <br> <br> <b>Tips:</b>
                    <br>Tip 1: In expert or master mode, use the shield of Cthulhu to dash into fishron, if you do not have time to dodge, 
                    as this will stop you taking damage if done right. 
                    <br>Tip 2: Also in expert or master mode, in the third stage, where fishron isinvisible, then dashes towards you, 
                    wait until it is about to dash, when you can first see its eyes, jump or go downwards, if in midair, to dodge the attack.

                    life fruit. For the first phase of the fight, just simply circle the boss, and you should avoid taking any damage.
                For the second phase, the boss becomes faster and harder to dodge. Using a rod of discord can </p>
